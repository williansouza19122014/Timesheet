## üîÑ Integration with Other Modules

### Related Endpoints:
- **Clients:** `/api/clients/:id` - Get client details for a project
- **Users:** `/api/users/:id` - Get user details for project members
- **TimeSheet:** `/api/timesheet?projectId=PROJECT_ID` - Time entries for a project

### Typical Workflow:
1. Create a client
2. Create project(s) for the client
3. Add team members to the project
4. Assign tasks/cards in Kanban
5. Track time in TimeSheet
6. Generate reports

## üìù Notes

- All dates are stored and returned in ISO 8601 format
- `isActive` is calculated based on the presence of `endDate`
- Project leaders are automatically managed (only one per project)
- Soft deletes preserve historical data for reporting
- All endpoints require authentication
- Managers/admins have full access (to be implemented in authorization middleware)
